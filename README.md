## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

  Runs the app in development mode.

* `npm run build` / `yarn build`
  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. Bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

* `npm test` / `yarn test`
  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. (If tests are configured.)
